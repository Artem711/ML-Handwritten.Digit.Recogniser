# Handwritten Digit Recogniser

This is my solution to the MNIST Digit data set. It lets the user draw a number on the screen and the software guess which digit it is.
To achieve this, a simple multi layer perceptron neural netwrok is used. Libraries used for ML are Tensorflow and Keras.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or below
Numpy
Matplotlib
Tensroflow
Keras
Pygame
TKinter
